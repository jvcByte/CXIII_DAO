## Test Results

### Test Case: `testFuzz_Vote`

**Description**: Tests the voting functionality with fuzzed inputs to ensure robustness.

#### Test Execution
```
Test Case: testFuzz_Vote(223830298867389177874791110299591, 2, "១t÷Ѩ.🪆")

1. Assumed valid vote state (1 or 2)
2. Set up test environment with admin and members
3. Created test proposal
4. Attempted to vote with fuzzed parameters
5. Test failed with: "Proposal deadline has passed"
```

#### Failure Analysis
- **Issue**: The test failed with a "Proposal deadline has passed" error when using a large proposal ID.
- **Root Cause**: The test uses fuzzed proposal IDs, and when an ID doesn't exist in the `proposals` mapping, it returns a default `Proposal` with `deadline = 0`. Since `block.timestamp` is always > 0, the check `block.timestamp < 0` fails.
- **Expected Behavior**: The test should verify the proposal exists before attempting to vote, or only test with valid proposal IDs.
- **Solution**: Add a check for proposal existence before voting.
  1. Added a new mapping `proposalExists` to track valid proposal IDs
  2. Updated `createProposal` to set `proposalExists[proposalCount] = true`
  3. Modified `vote` and `fulfillProposal` to check `proposalExists[id]` before proceeding
